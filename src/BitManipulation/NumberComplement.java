476. Number Complement

    Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.



    Example 1:

    Input: num = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
    Example 2:

    Input: num = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.


    Constraints:

    The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    num >= 1
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
    This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
